'''
Your task, Create a flowchart and IPO chart, then write a program to create the
game of 31 or UNO. Create a trace table on one of your errors. You will be using
at least one card class and some basic graphics in PyGame. Donâ€™t forget
instructions.
'''

# For this question I coded the game of UNO
# This game works with up to 4 players and follows standard UNO rules
# To play this game type in console how many players there should be, and it will start

# If I had more time for this assignment, I would have coded more action cards
# Currently the only action card is the reverse direction card
