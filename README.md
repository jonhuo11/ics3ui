## ICS3UI 2019-2020

A collection of Python projects and code snippets that I wrote while studying computer science in ICS3UI, taught by J Harris. Several pygame projects are featured, including recreations of popular games such as snakes and ladders, guess who, and UNO.

There are 4 python programs under assignment 2 (A2) and 5 under assignment 3 (A3). In addition there is guess\_who.py and snakes\_and_ladders.py which are the two course summative projects that were written for evaluation. The description for each file is listed below in this document, and at the top of every python file there should be a comment explaining the purpose of the file as well.

## A2 --> Assignment 2, Questions 1, 3, 4, 5 from ICS3U during Semester 1 of 2019-20
1. Create a flowchart, then write a program to perform a unit conversion of
your own choosing. Make sure that the program prints an introduction that explains what it
does. User output is important for understanding. Typical conversions are temperature,
measurements, speed, etc. meet level 3 curriculum expectations.
3. Please create a flowchart, and 2 or more functions, using random to create something
impressive with turtle. Once your teacher has briefly checked your flowchart AND given a check
mark in her class documentation, you should create this program using turtle and random. It
should be something small on the appropriate background (School GP please) thats similar, but
totally different from any of the examples in class or the ones in the reading materials.
Exception: You may use the random function below for star, if we do this in
class (it will earn a level 3)
4. Using your knowledge of Pygame, create a landscape (grass, a house, trees, sky with either
sun and cloud or moon and stars) and anything else you want to add.
5. WOW me with your Pygame knowledge. Create a flowchart and then write a program that
uses any valid function not already used in this assignment.

## A3 --> Assignment 3, Question 1 to 5 from ICS3U Semester 1 of 2019-20
1. I/O Question: Find a data set you are interested in. (If stuck,
go to Environment Canada or U of W weather stats and
download something.) The data set must have at least 100
rows and 10 columns. Create a flowchart, then write a program
that reads in your txt or csv file and writes out a summary file
containing averages and/or max and min values for the data set
and whatever other total information is relevant.
2. Take your dataset from question 1 and sort it using each of the sorts from class.
Record the length of time each sort took and display that to the screen
comparing the types of sort. Create an IPO chart and trace table for this
question. Hint: time in milliseconds, before you run the search and after.
3. Your task, Create a flowchart and IPO chart, then write a program to create the
game of 31 or UNO. Create a trace table on one of your errors. You will be using
at least one card class and some basic graphics in PyGame. Donâ€™t forget
instructions. Instructions: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/thirty-one/

4. Create something recursive. Create a flowchart and IPO chart, very clearly
identify your base case. You may not use the Koch snowflake, or the Tower of
Hanoi. If you are stuck I suggest a palindrome checker.
5. WOW me with your Pygame Sprite knowledge. You may
use one I gave you in class or create your own. Have fun
with this one!

## Snakes And Ladders, Midterm Project
1. Recreate snakes and latters using whatever resources are available.

## Guess Who, Course Summative Project
1. Recreate guess who using whatever resources are available.
